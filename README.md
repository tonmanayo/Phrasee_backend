# PHRASEE BACK END TECHNICAL TEST

My implimentation of the Phrasee **backend end** technical test

I choose to use Azure functions. Only having 4 hours to complete the task I thoight this would be a good option as it allows me to get going really fast, and easily host the API's
I thought this was good option because the task was to transform some data using 3 endpoints and not really build an application using a certain framework.

I did not do a TDD approach as I thought it would be better time spent on showing a clean technical ability to solve the task at hand. If this was a prod build there would be unit tests.
I used **Typescript**

This was a **fun task**, I really enjoyed it and feel like I have demonstrated some clean basic coding.
There are some mocked out functions like token decoding and basic object serialization.
