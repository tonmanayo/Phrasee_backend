PHRASEE BACK END TECHNICAL TEST
 
You are tasked with writing the algorithm that takes a feed of notifications and aggregates them. The algorithm should be packaged in a web server that exposes three endpoints:
- The first endpoint will provide the functionality to retrieve an aggregated list of notifications for a given post. We are looking for a response that is as close to production ready as possible.
- The second endpoint will expose a POST method that will add an element to this feed of notifications.
- The third and last endpoint should expose the functionality to mark these feeds as read.
 
The notification feed is from a hypothetical social website that allows users to write posts, like posts and comment on posts. 
The notifications can be of two types: Like and Comment. 
Like indicates that one user liked a user's post and Comment indicates that one user commented on a user's post.
 
You'll be provided with a file containing a JSON of the notifications feed. 
Use your judgement for a suitable aggregation bearing in mind this will be displayed on a web UI. 
Please note that the order in which the notifications are served or aggregated is irrelevant.

Please do not take more than approximately 4 HOURS on this test. 
If you find you cannot complete it to your satisfaction, please write down how you would intend to finish, we will take that into account.
The test results should be packaged either as a .zip file or as a link to a git repository.
